 * Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.
 * According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia:
 * ��The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes v and w as the lowest node in T that has both v and w as descendants
 * (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).��
